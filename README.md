# athletic_sales_analysis
Module 5 Challenge
This weeks activity covered groupby, pivot tables, some binning to look at the sales data for athletic apparel for brands. I started by importing the starter code into my repository and then imported the CSVs and read in the CSV files

I checked for any null values and converted the invoice_date to datetime and confirmed that worked.

Then using groupby and pivot i determined which regions sold the most products, which regions had the most sales, and which retailer had the most sales. Even though we had to get the same data in two different ways for all three of these it was easy to re-use code for groupby's and pivot tables from the previous example so this didn't take too long.
